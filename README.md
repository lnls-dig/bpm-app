# Beam Position Monitor Application Software

This repository contains all the necessary scripts for deployment of the BPM
IOCs. They can be found in `scripts/`:

- `update_afc_ioc.sh` for AFC IOCs
- `update_rffe_iocs.sh` for RFFE IOCs

They require that your SSH keys be registered on the crates you wish to
control.
